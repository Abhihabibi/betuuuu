      <h2>🌸 The First Night</h2>
      <p>We first met online. That night, your mum wasn’t home and you were scared being alone.  
      So we decided to video call — and somehow, one call turned into hours of talking, laughing, and just being there for each other until the morning.  
      That night wasn’t just a conversation, it was the start of something so beautiful.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="memory">
      <h2>💌 Late Night Talks</h2>
      <p>Since then, late night talks became our thing. Nights that were supposed to end with sleep always ended with laughter, secrets, and comfort.  
      Every “goodnight” slowly turned into “let’s talk a little more” until the stars faded into morning light.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="memory">
      <h2>🐻 Betuu Bachhu</h2>
      <p>I call you <b>Betuu Bachhu</b> because you’re more than just my love — you’re my comfort, my safe place, my happiness.  
      Every nickname has a piece of my heart, and every time I say it, I feel closer to you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="memory">
      <h2>❤️ Beyond Words</h2>
      <p>We never needed to name what we share. It’s beyond labels, beyond definitions.  
      What we have is something only we understand — deeper than words, stronger than distance, and more magical than anyone could imagine.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="memory">
      <h2>🎉 Forever Us</h2>
      <p>Today, I just want to remind you that our story is my favorite story.  
      From that first video call to every single late night talk, I wouldn’t change a single moment.  
      Happy Birthday, my Aastha ❤️ — your Chiku will always be here.</p>
